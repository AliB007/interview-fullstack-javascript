thank you again for applying for the Junior Fullstack developer position at it-excelsus GmbH. With the following task we would like to verify your coding skills. Expected timeline for this assignemtn is to be finished in one week.

Below you can find 3 folders. The frontend and backend are just simple inital applications generaed from respective CLI tools. The [`frontend`](./frontend) is an React.ts application and the [`backend`](./backend) is a NestJS 10 backend application. The [`database`](./database) is an example of how a database could look like when contains data.

## What is the task?

1. On the frontend replace the existing content with a form where you can search for a city and list the results in some list formatted below. Design the application as you please.
2. On the backend prepare an endpoint to return the list of the cities which is matching the entry submitted from the frontend. Ideally, you will return up to 5 entries per page. As well as implement CRUD endpoints to Create, Read, Update and Delete new cities.
3. On the database create a database of your choise (SQL or NoSQL) what would be in your opinion better for this usecase.

Bonus: When you can implement the CRUD endpoints into the frontend as well.
